% Notes on hyperref:
% IEEEtran.cls attempts to be compliant with the hyperref package, written
% by Heiko Oberdiek and Sebastian Rahtz, which provides hyperlinks within
% a document as well as an index for PDF files (produced via pdflatex).
% However, it is a tad difficult to properly interface LaTeX classes and
% packages with this (necessarily) complex and invasive package. It is
% recommended that hyperref not be used for work that is to be submitted
% to the IEEE. Users who wish to use hyperref *must* ensure that their
% hyperref version is 6.72u or later *and* IEEEtran.cls is version 1.6b 
% or later. The latest version of hyperref can be obtained at:
%
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref/
%
% Also, be aware that cite.sty (as of version 3.9, 11/2001) and hyperref.sty
% (as of version 6.72t, 2002/07/25) do not work optimally together.
% To mediate the differences between these two packages, IEEEtran.cls, as
% of v1.6b, predefines a command that fools hyperref into thinking that
% the natbib package is being used - causing it not to modify the existing
% citation commands, and allowing cite.sty to operate as normal. However,
% as a result, citation numbers will not be hyperlinked. Another side effect
% of this approach is that the natbib.sty package will not properly load
% under IEEEtran.cls. However, current versions of natbib are not capable
% of compressing and sorting citation numbers in IEEE's style - so this
% should not be an issue. If, for some strange reason, the user wants to
% load natbib.sty under IEEEtran.cls, the following code must be placed
% before natbib.sty can be loaded:
%
% \makeatletter
% \let\NAT@parse\undefined
% \makeatother
%
% Hyperref should be loaded differently depending on whether pdflatex
% or traditional latex is being used:
%
\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
\usepackage[hypertex,dvipdfm]{hyperref}
\else
\usepackage[pdftex,hypertexnames=false,pdfstartview=FitH]{hyperref}
\fi
%
% Pdflatex produces superior hyperref results and is the recommended
% compiler for such use.



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
% no \PARstart
Recently, along with the development of new solutions, the wide-band response of
electromagnetic scattering has received considerable attention
\cite{kashyap:stabilizing:1998,hujinlin:temporal:2001,jung:cfie:2002,jizhong:solving:2006}.
Researches
on time-domain integral equation have more remarkable development. T. K.
Sarkar {\em et al.} present a marching on in order method, which
reduces the late-time instability of marching on in time (MOT) related
methods \cite{jizhong:solving:2006,jung:accurate:2002,jung:analysis:2004,jung:time:2003}. In these algorithms the time-domain integral equations
are expressed in terms of weighted Laguerre polynomials with a time
scaling factor. The scaling parameters are chosen in above references
without given a general principle for choosing an optimal one. In this
paper, based on the analysis to the characteristics of weighted Laguerre
polynomials, the effects of the time scaling factor are discussed and the
principle of choosing an optimal one is proposed. Further, transient scattering analysis for arbitrary shaped structures is studied using the 
weighted Laguerre polynomials as temporal basis. The calculation examples show that the choice
principle for time scaling factor proposed here is effective.

\section{The Characteristic Properties of the Weighted Laguerre
Polynomials}

The normalized order $k$ Laguerre polynomial can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
L_k(t)=\frac{\mathrm{e}^t}{k!}\frac{\mathrm{d}^k}{\mathrm{d}t^k}(t^k\mathrm{e}^{-t}),\;
\text{for $k\ge 0,\:t\ge 0$}.
\end{equation}
These polynomials satisfy a recursive relationship given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
L_0(t)&=1 \\
L_1(t)&=1-t \\
L_k(t)&=\frac{1}{k}\left [ (2k-1-t)L_{k-1}(t)\right . \\
 &\quad \left . -(k-1)L_{k-2}(t)\right ]
\;\;\;\;\text{for $k\ge 2$.}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
They are orthogonal with respect to the weighted function
$\mathrm{e}^{-t}$, given by
\begin{equation}
\int _{0}^{\infty}\mathrm{e}^{-t}L_i(t)L_k(t)\mathrm{d}t=\delta _{ik},
\end{equation}
where $\delta _{ik}$ is a Kronecker delta for $i=k$ and zero otherwise.
Therefore, an orthonormal set of basis functions at $[0,\:\infty)$ can be derived through
the representation
\begin{equation}
\phi _k(t)=\mathrm{e}^{-t/2}L_k(t).
\end{equation}
Using these basis functions, any arbitrary causal signal $e_n(t)$ can be
expanded as
\begin{equation}
e_n(t)=\sum _{k=0}^{\infty}c_{n,k}\phi _k(st),
\end{equation}
where $s>0$ is a time scaling factor. By controlling the time scaling
factor, the support provided by the expansion can be increased or
decreased.

The weighted Laguerre polynomials mentioned here have the following
characteristic properties.
\begin{enumerate}
\item derivative \cite{jung:time:2003}: $L_k'(y)=L_k(y)-(k+1)L_k(y)$. The first and second
derivatives of $e_n(t)$ with respect to time $t$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\dot{e}_n(t)&=s\sum _{k=0}^{\infty}\left [\frac{1}{2}c_{n,k}+\sum
_{i=0}^{k-1}c_{n,i}\right ]\phi _k(st) \\
\ddot{e}_n(t)&=s^2\sum _{k=0}^{\infty}\left [\frac{1}{4}c_{n,k}+\sum
_{i=0}^{k-1}c_{n,i}\right ]\phi _k(st).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\item integration \cite{gradshteyn:table:1980}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
I_{ik}(st_0)&=\int
_0^{\infty}\phi_i(st)\phi_k(st-st_0)\mathrm{d}(st) \\
&=\begin{cases}\mathrm{e}^{-st_0/2}[L_{i-k}(st_0)-L_{i-k-1}(st_0)]&k<i\\
    \mathrm{e}^{-st_0/2}&k=i\\
    0&k>i\end{cases}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\item limit: 
\begin{equation}
\lim _{y\rightarrow 0}\frac{\phi_k(y)-1}{y}=-(k+\frac{1}{2}).
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Choice of the Scaling Factor $s$}

The Fourier transform of order $k$ weighted Laguerre polynomial is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Phi_k(\mathrm{j}\omega)&=\frac{(-1/2+\mathrm{j}\omega)^k}{(1/2+\mathrm{j}\omega)^{k+1}}\\
\lvert{\Phi_k(\mathrm{j}\omega)}\rvert&=\frac{2}{\sqrt{1+4\omega^2}},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig1}. Its $\unit{-20}{\deci\bel}$
bandwidth is about $\unit{0.8}{\hertz}$. As the basis functions for a
$\unit{}{\mega\hertz}\sim\unit{}{\giga\hertz}$ signal, this scale is very
small. In order to use the above basis functions in an appropriate
fashion, one should transform the interval using an appropriate scaling 
factor $s$. Since the Fourier transform obeys a similarity theorem,
changing temporal scale inversely affects frequency and amplitude, that is,
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{F}[\phi_k(st)]=\frac{1}{s}\Phi_k(\frac{\mathrm{j}\omega}{s}).
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.48]{lagu.pdf}
    \caption{The Fourier spectrum of weighted Laguerre polynomials.}
    \label{fig1}
\end{figure}

Let's take a look at the principles to choose an optimal time scaling factor
$s$. Consider an arbitrary causal signal $f(t)$ with time duration of $T_f$
and approximately band limited on $B$, which can be expressed by the
orthogonal weighted Laguerre polynomials as
\begin{equation}
f(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{N}a_k\phi_k(st).
\end{equation}
Theoretically there should be $N\rightarrow\infty$. Since the signal that
we are interested in characterizing is practically bandlimited up to
$B$, Ref.~\cite{jung:time:2003} proposes the minimum number of temporal basis
functions is $2BT_f+1$. If the number of basis functions is less than
this minimum number, the results will be unacceptable.

It's important to search for a better value of time scaling factor $s$ to
expand an causal signal correctly. If $s$ is too small, the spectrum of
basis functions will not cover the one of original signal; and if $s$ is
too big, the original signal can not either be expressed by the weighted
Laguerre polynomials. Here shows the effect of $s$ when a Gaussian pulse
is expanded with the mentioned basis functions.

A Gaussian pulse is mathematically represented by
\begin{equation}
f(t)=\mathrm{e}^{-\gamma^2}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma=(4/T)(ct-ct_0)$, $c$ is the velocity of light in the air.
We use $T=4$ and $ct_0=10$. Both of these quantities are defined in
light meters (lm), which is the time taken by light to traverse
\unit{1}{\meter}. The $\unit{-40}{\deci\bel}$ bandwidth $B$ of the pulse
is approximately $\unit{750}{\mega\hertz}$, $T_f\approx 20/c$. We now
compute the error between the constructed signal with basis functions
and the original signal as follows:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon(s)=\sqrt{\int_0^\infty\left | f(t)-\sum_{k=0}^N
a_k\phi_k(st)\right | ^2\mathrm{d}t}.\label{error-eq}
\end{equation}
Fig.~\ref{error} plot the error given by (\ref{error-eq}) as a function of
the time scaling factor $s$. As can be seen the appropriate $s$ can
give more accurate results. In our example, the optimal $s=nB,\;\;(n=2\sim 5)$.

\section{The Application of Weighted Laguerre Polynomials in Transient
RCS Analysis}
The scattering from a conducting sphere is simulated with the 
marching-on-in-order method \cite{jizhong:solving:2006}, in which the integral equation is
solved by expressing the transient bebaviors in terms of the Laguerre
functions. The sphere is with a spatial discretization of 909 common
edges and has a radius of \unit{0.45}{\meter}. The scattering from this
sphere have been simulated when the excitation is the Gaussian pluse
with $T=99.7(\mathrm{lm})$, $ct_0=100.5(\mathrm{lm})$.
Fig.~\ref{scatter} shows the backward scattered farfield from the sphere
when the scaling factor $s$ are $0.40c$, $0.80c$, $0.16c$, $1.60c$,
respectively, where $0.40c$ and $0.80c$ are in the range obtained from
the above principles for searching optimal $s$ scaling factor, $0.16c$ and
$1.60c$ is out of that range. The results gotten with $s=0.40c$ and $s=0.80c$ agree well
with the theoretical results for the same object. The other two curves
then is not very accurate.

\section{Conclusion}

It's worthy to research thoroughly the properties of weighted Laguerre
polynomials for transient electromagnetic scattering problems. In this
paper, the time domain characteristics of weighted Laguerre polynomials are
studied. The influence of the time scaling factor and its choice
principles are also discussed,
which establish the basis of transient
electromagnetic scattering analysis and should be further researched.
