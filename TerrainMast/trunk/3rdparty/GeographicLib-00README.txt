This is the 2009-10 version of the library.

Changes between 2009-10 and 2009-09 versions:

  * Change web site to http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net

  * Several house-cleaning changes:
    + Change from the a flat directory structure to a more easily
      maintained one.
    + Introduce Math class for common mathematical functions (in
      Constants.hpp).
    + Use Math::real as the type for all real quantities.  By default this
      is typedefed to double; and the library should be installed this
      way.
    + Eliminate const reference members of AzimuthalEquidistant,
      CassiniSoldner and LocalCartesian so that they may be copied.
    + Make several constructors explicit.  Disallow some constructors.
      Disallow copy constructor/assignment for Geoid.
    + Document least square formulas in Geoid.cpp.
    + Use unsigned long long for files positions of geoid files in Geoid.
    + Introduce optional mgrslimits argument in UTMUPS::Forward and
      UTMUPS::Reverse to enforce stricter MGRS limits on eastings and
      northings.in
    + Add 64-bit targets in Visual Studio project files.

Changes between 2009-09 and 2009-08 versions:

  * Add GeographicLib::Geoid and GeoidEval utility.

Changes between 2009-08 and 2009-07 versions:

  * Add GeographicLib::CassiniSoldner class and EquidistantTest utility.

  * Fix bug in GeographicLib::Geodesic::Inverse where NaNs were
    sometimes returned.

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: AzimuthalEquidistant now returns the reciprocal
    of the azimuthal scale instead of the reduced length.

  * Add -n option to GeoConvert.

Changes between 2009-07 and 2009-06 versions:

  * Speed up the series inversion code in tmseries.mac and geod.mac.

  * Reference Borkowski in section on Geocentric coordinates.

Changes between 2009-06 and 2009-05 versions:

  * Add routines to decode and encode zone+hemisphere to GeographicLib::UTMUPS.

  * Clean up code in GeographicLib::Geodesic.

Changes between 2009-05 and 2009-04 versions:

  * Improvements to GeographicLib::Geodesic:
    + more economical series expansions,
    + return reduced length (as does the Geod utility),
    + improved calculation of starting point for inverse method,
    + use reduced length to give derivative for Newton's method.

  * Add AzimuthalEquidistant class.

  + Make GeographicLib::Geocentric, GeographicLib::TransverseMercator,
    and GeographicLib::PolarStereographic classes work with prolate
    ellipsoids.

  * CartConvert checks its inputs more carefully.

  * Remove reference to defunct Constants.cpp from GeographicLib.vcproj.

Changes between 2009-04 and 2009-03 versions:

  * Use compile-time constants to select the order of series in
    GeographicLib::TransverseMercator.

  * 2x unroll of Clenshaw summation to avoid data shuffling.

  * Simplification of GeographicLib::EllipticFunction::E.

  * Use STATIC_ASSERT for compile-time checking of constants.

  * Improvements to GeographicLib::Geodesic:
    + compile-time option to change order of series used,
    + post maxima code for generating the series,
    + tune the order of series for double,
    + improvements in the selection of starting points for Newton's
      method,
    + accept and return spherical arc lengths,
    + works with both oblate and prolate spheroids,
    + add -a, -e, -b options to the Geod utility.

Changes between 2009-03 and 2009-02 versions:

  * Add GeographicLib::Geodesic and the Geod utility.

  * Declare when no exceptions are thrown by functions.

  * Minor changes to GeographicLib::DMS class.

  * Use invf = 0 to mean a sphere in constructors to some classes.

  * The makefile creates a library and includes an install target.

  * Rename GeographicLib::ECEF to GeographicLib::Geocentric, ECEFConvert
    to CartConvert.

  * Use inline functions to define constant doubles in Constants.hpp.

Changes between 2009-02 and 2009-01 versions:

  * Fix documentation of constructors (flattening -> inverse
    flattening).

  * Use std versions of math functions.

  * Add ECEF and LocalCartesian classes and ECEFConvert utility.

  * Gather the documentation on the utility programs onto one page.
